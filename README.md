## Match the Card 

Submitted by: Ashwani Balakrishnan Neminimadathil

Match the Card is a flutter gaming application where players need to match pairs of cards. Players will be presented with a grid of face-down cards, and they must flip the cards to find matching pairs. On matching all pairs of cards, the user is declared to be the Winner.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Design a user interface that includes a grid of face-down cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6 grid).
* [x] Each card should initially display a back design (e.g., a common pattern or image).
* [x] Implement an animation that flips the cards from face-down to face-up and vice versa when tapped.
* [x] Implement the game logic to track which cards are currently face-up and face-down.
* [x] When a player taps two face-down cards, check if they match. If they do, keep them face-up; otherwise, flip them face-down again.
* [x] Implement a win condition to check if all pairs have been matched. When all pairs are matched, display a victory message
